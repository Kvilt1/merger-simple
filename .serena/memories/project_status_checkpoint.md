# Snapchat Media Mapper Project Status

## Current Implementation State
- Basic media mapping: ✅ Working
- Single file overlay merging: ✅ Working (but uses deprecated filter)
- Multi-part video detection: ✅ Working
- Multi-part video processing: ⚠️ Partially working (needs filter fix)
- Media ID mapping: ✅ Working
- MP4 timestamp mapping: ✅ Working
- Conversation organization: ✅ Working

## Known Issues
1. **Critical**: FFmpeg filter using deprecated scale2ref needs replacement
2. **Fixed**: Missing os import (added)
3. **Fixed**: UTF-8 encoding typo in utils.py
4. **Fixed**: ~zip- files incorrectly included in multi-part detection

## Multi-Part Video Feature Status
### Working:
- Detection of multiple overlays for same date
- Verification that overlays are identical (MD5 hash)
- Folder creation and organization
- timestamps.json generation
- File preservation and copying

### Not Working:
- Overlay application fails due to deprecated filter
- Produces audio-only files (no video stream)
- Need to update both single and multi-part processing

## Next Implementation Priority
Replace FFmpeg filter in both:
1. Line ~101-102: Single file processing
2. Line ~189-190: Multi-part processing

Both should use the modern filter pattern documented in ffmpeg_overlay_patterns memory.
