# Multi-Part Video Consolidation Fix Session

## Problem Discovered
- Multi-part videos with identical overlays were failing to process correctly
- FFmpeg's `scale2ref` filter is deprecated and was producing videos with no video stream (only audio)
- The issue only affected multi-part processing, not single file overlay merging

## Root Cause
- The FFmpeg filter complex using `scale2ref` was failing silently
- `scale2ref` is deprecated in favor of `scale=rw:rh` 
- FFmpeg was returning success (exit code 0) but producing files with no video frames

## Solution Implemented
1. Fixed media file filtering to properly exclude ~zip- files from multi-part detection
2. Added validation to check if FFmpeg output has video stream using ffprobe
3. Modified process_multipart_video to use same FFmpeg command as single files
4. Used subprocess.run with check=True for consistent error handling

## Key Code Changes
- Fixed line 52: Changed `"_media~zip-"` check to properly exclude zip files
- Enhanced process_multipart_video with proper error handling and validation
- Added successful_parts counter to track processing success

## Testing Results
- Successfully processed 2025-07-18 multi-part video with 2 parts
- Other multi-part videos (2025-07-20, 2025-08-09) still need filter fix
- Single file overlay merging continues to work correctly

## Next Steps Required
- Replace deprecated scale2ref filter with modern alternative
- Use simpler filter: `[1:v]scale=w='min(main_w,iw)':h='min(main_h,ih)',format=rgba[ovr]`
- This scales overlay to fit within video dimensions while preserving aspect ratio
- Center the overlay using: `overlay=(main_w-overlay_w)/2:(main_h-overlay_h)/2`

## Files Modified
- map_media.py: Main processing logic and FFmpeg commands
- utils.py: Fixed UTF-8 encoding typo

## Session Duration
Approximately 45 minutes of investigation and implementation
