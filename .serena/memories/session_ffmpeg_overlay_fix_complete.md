# FFmpeg Overlay Multi-part Video Fix - Session Summary

## Date: 2025-08-26
## Status: COMPLETED ✅

## Problem Solved:
Fixed multi-part video processing where overlays were not being applied correctly, resulting in unplayable files with only audio streams.

## Root Cause:
The FFmpeg filter was using the deprecated `scale2ref` incorrectly, and then when simplified, wasn't scaling the overlay to match the video dimensions at all.

## Solution Applied:
Replaced the FFmpeg filter complex with the modern approach that properly scales overlays to match video dimensions.

### Working FFmpeg Filter:
```python
"[1:v][0:v]scale=w=rw:h=rh,format=rgba[ovr];[0:v][ovr]overlay=0:0:format=auto[vout]"
```

This filter:
1. Takes overlay [1:v] and video [0:v] as inputs
2. Scales overlay to reference dimensions (rw=video width, rh=video height) 
3. Converts to RGBA for transparency
4. Overlays at position 0:0 (top-left)

## Additional Improvements:
1. **Thumbnail Exclusion**: Completely removed thumbnails from all processing stages
   - Not copied to temp_media
   - Not included in orphaned files
   - Filtered at lines 473-474 and 673-679

## Files Modified:
- `map_media.py`:
  - Lines 101, 189: Updated FFmpeg filter for overlay scaling
  - Line 473-474: Added thumbnail exclusion from temp_media copy
  - Line 673-679: Added thumbnail exclusion from orphaned files

## Test Results:
- July 18 multi-part videos: ✅ Successfully processed with proper video streams
- File sizes: Correct (373K, 2.1M instead of broken 25K, 123K)
- Video format: h264, 480x854 confirmed working

## Key Learnings:
1. scale2ref is deprecated in FFmpeg 7.x - use scale with rw/rh instead
2. FFmpeg can return exit code 0 even when producing broken output
3. Always verify video streams exist in output, not just successful completion
4. Overlays need explicit scaling to match video dimensions
