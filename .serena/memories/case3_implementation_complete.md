# Case 3 Implementation: Multiple Non-Identical Overlays

## Overview
Successfully implemented Case 3 logic to handle days with multiple media files and multiple non-identical overlay files.

## Key Components Added

### 1. Helper Functions
- `group_overlays_by_hash()`: Groups overlays by MD5 hash content
- `extract_and_group_media_by_timestamp()`: Groups media files with close timestamps (within threshold)
- `match_overlay_and_media_groups()`: Matches overlay and media groups by file count
- `process_grouped_multipart_video()`: Creates folders for multi-file groups

### 2. Case 3 Logic
- Triggers when multiple overlays are non-identical
- Groups overlays by hash and media by timestamp
- Matches groups based on file count (unique counts prioritized)
- Single-file groups are processed as individual files (no folder)
- Multi-file groups create `_grouped` folders

### 3. Integration Points Fixed
- `index_media_files()`: Now indexes both `_multipart` and `_grouped` folders
- Orphaned handling: Copies both folder types to orphaned directory
- Timestamp mapping: Includes `_grouped` folders in Phase 2 mapping

## File Changes
- **map_media.py lines 155-391**: Added helper functions
- **map_media.py lines 86-244**: Case 3 processing logic
- **map_media.py line 626**: Index both folder types
- **map_media.py line 936**: Include both in timestamp mapping
- **map_media.py line 987**: Handle both in orphaned files

## Testing Results
- Successfully detects and processes multiple non-identical overlays
- Creates `_grouped` folders for multi-file groups
- Single-file groups are merged directly without folders
- Proper mapping to conversations via timestamps
